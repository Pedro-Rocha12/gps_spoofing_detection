# GPS Spoofing Detection

## Overview
This project focuses on detecting GPS spoofing attacks using machine learning techniques. GPS spoofing is a significant security threat where false GPS signals are transmitted to deceive GPS receivers about their location.

## Features
- Real-time GPS signal analysis
- Machine learning-based spoofing detection
- Data collection and preprocessing tools
- Performance metrics evaluation

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Pedro-Rocha12/gps_spoofing_detection.git
cd gps_spoofing_detection
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Configure your GPS receiver settings
2. Run the detection system:
```bash
python main.py
```
